Great work on completing the project and setting up the visuals! I’ll help refine and structure the steps for your GitHub presentation, including a detailed explanation of your measures, data, and project steps in a separate file. Here’s how we’ll proceed:

---

### **1. GitHub Repository Updates**
- Repository Name: `finance-dashboard-powerbi`
- **Files to Include:**
  - `README.md`: Overview of the project and links to the Power BI report.
  - A new file, `steps.md`: Detailed step-by-step guide for the project.
  - Folders for visuals, Power BI files, and supporting assets (like background images).

---

### **2. Draft for `steps.md`**
I’ll write your step-by-step process in a polished format with explanations and proper structure. Let’s start with a draft version.

# Steps to Create the Finance Dashboard in Power BI

## 1. Data Preparation
### Transforming Data
- Create a **Pivot Table** to organize data into the following columns:
  - `Type`: Categories like Income, Savings, Expenses, and Target.
  - `Component`: Sub-categories of each type (e.g., Groceries, Health).
  - `Date`: Timestamp for each transaction.
  - `Value`: The amount associated with each entry.
- Ensure the `Date` column is formatted as a **Date** type.
- Load the transformed data into Power BI and apply necessary formatting.

## 2. Calculated Measures
### Key Measures
1. **Total Value**: 
   ```DAX
   Total_Value = SUM('Dataset'[Value])
   ```
2. **Income**:
   ```DAX
   Income = CALCULATE([Total_Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Income")
   ```
3. **Savings**:
   ```DAX
   Savings = CALCULATE([Total_Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Savings")
   ```
4. **Expenses**:
   ```DAX
   Expenses = CALCULATE([Total_Value], 'Dataset'[Type] = "Expense")
   ```

### Savings Percentage
- Measure to calculate the percentage of income saved:
  ```DAX
  Saving% = DIVIDE([Savings], [Income], 0)
  ```
- Format as **Percentage** with 0 decimal points.

---

## 3. Adding Date Columns
- In **Table View**, create calculated columns:
  ```DAX
  Year = FORMAT('Dataset'[Date], "yyyy")
  Month-yr = FORMAT('Dataset'[Date], "mmm-yy")
  ```

---

## 4. Report View: Building Visualizations
### 4.1 Slicer for Years
- Add a **Tile Slicer** for the `Year` column:
  - Enable "Select All".
  - Adjust layout to show 1 row and 5 columns.
  - Format the slicer (e.g., set button colors, rounded borders).

### 4.2 Donut Charts
- Create two **Donut Charts** for:
  1. **Expenses by Component**
  2. **Savings by Component**
- Add titles, borders, and custom colors.

### 4.3 Line Chart
- Add a **Line Chart** to show trends for Income, Savings, and Expenses over time:
  - **X-Axis**: Date.
  - **Y-Axis**: Measures (Income, Savings, Expenses).

---

## 5. Advanced Measures
### Monthly Growth
- Measure to calculate month-over-month growth:
  ```DAX
  Monthly_Growth = DIVIDE([Monthly_sale] - [PY_Month_Sale], [PY_Month_Sale], 0)
  ```
- Create additional measures for specific categories (e.g., Expenses, Savings).

---

## 6. Dynamic Interactions
### Dynamic Line Chart
- Create a new table for dynamic line selection:
  ```DAX
  Line_Selection_Table = DATATABLE("Type", STRING, "NO", INTEGER, {
      {"Income", 1}, 
      {"Savings", 2}, 
      {"Expenses", 3}, 
      {"Target", 4}
  })
  ```

- Measure for dynamic display:
  ```DAX
  Line_Chart_Measures = 
  VAR Selected_val = SELECTEDVALUE(Line_Selection_Table[NO])
  RETURN SWITCH(Selected_val, 1, [Income], 2, [Savings], 3, [Expenses], 4, [Target])
  ```

### Tooltip Pages
- Set up additional pages (e.g., `T1`, `T2`) for detailed tooltips.
- Add interactive tooltips for Donut Charts.

---

## 7. Final Touches
- Add a slicer for `Month-yr` with a "Show/Hide" toggle button.
- Format all visuals with consistent fonts, colors, and borders.
- Add a dynamic title for the dashboard:
  ```DAX
  Dynamic_Title = SELECTEDVALUE(Line_Selection_Table[Type]) & " by Date"
  ```

---

## 8. Publish and Share
- Save the Power BI file (`finance_dashboard.pbix`) and publish it to the Power BI service.
- Generate a public link to share the dashboard:
  [Finance Dashboard on Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNGMyYjI2NzEtNjhmMi00NjNkLWJiM2YtOGRkYTU3MTg2NjkyIiwidCI6IjFjOTU3MTRkLTczMWEtNDVmZS04YjY2LWMwNTI2MmY4OGZjZSJ9).

---

## Appendix
- Include explanations for each measure, why it was created, and the insights it provides.
- Add visuals and screenshots of the dashboard (from your PDF file) to illustrate each step.
```
